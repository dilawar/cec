Columbia Esterel Compiler (Hacked version) 
==========================================

This is a hacked version of cec-0.4. The original is available [here](
http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/cec/). 

On develop branch, I play with this compiler. The first commit of this compiler
is compiled with gcc-4.7. If you are looking for the standard compiler which
compiles easily with gcc4.7, clone the first commit. DO NOT clone it otherwise.


This is only to play with this language.
