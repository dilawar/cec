Columbia Esterel Compiler (Hacked version) 
==========================================

This is a somewhat hacked version of cec-0.4. The original is available [here](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/cec/).

I've added `cmake` based build system. To build and install use the following commands

```
cmake .
make 
sudo make install 
```

Packages  
========
You can install it using my repository on Open Build Service https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Adilawar&package=cec
